# repo-contributions

# Contributors Task

## Basic version:
- Create a search field with a (repo) typeahead, where user can type github username and the search would return the list of users github repos
- The user can then select a repo from the typeahead and the app should display a graph of contributions per user for this repo (x axis users, y axis number of contributions)
- Make sure to handle the case if a username does not exist or a user does not have any repos
- The user can then select a repo from the typeahead and the app should display a graph contributions per use for this repo (x axis users, y axis number of contributions)

## Fancy version:
- Use ECMAScript 6
- Make it look nice design-wise

## Additional info:
- Api points needed (repos and contributors) - e.g.: https://api.github.com/users/angular/repos, https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/contributors
- Feel free to use any framework (React, Vue, Angular) or open API, that could make the assigment better

## General guidelines:
- The code should be readable and clearly commented when needed
- The project should be pushed to a public github repository
- The README.md should contain a basic project documentation (how to run and build the project locally from scratch, project structure, gotchas,... anything worth mentioning)
